# Atmosphere Overview

## Composition
The atmosphere is a mixture of gases surrounding the Earth, held by gravity. It consists primarily of:
- **Nitrogen (N₂):** ~78%
- **Oxygen (O₂):** ~21%
- **Argon (Ar):** ~0.93%
- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂):** ~0.04%
- **Trace Gases:** Includes neon, helium, methane, krypton, and hydrogen.

## Structure
The atmosphere is divided into five main layers based on temperature gradients:

1. **Troposphere:**
   - Extends up to ~8-15 km.
   - Weather phenomena occur here.
   - Temperature decreases with altitude.

2. **Stratosphere:**
   - Extends from ~15 km to ~50 km.
   - Contains the ozone layer, which absorbs UV radiation.
   - Temperature increases with altitude due to ozone absorption.

3. **Mesosphere:**
   - Extends from ~50 km to ~85 km.
   - Temperature decreases with altitude.
   - Meteors burn up in this layer.

4. **Thermosphere:**
   - Extends from ~85 km to ~600 km.
   - Temperature increases significantly with altitude.
   - Contains ionized gases; auroras occur here.

5. **Exosphere:**
   - Extends from ~600 km to ~10,000 km.
   - Transition zone to outer space.
   - Very low densities of hydrogen and helium.

## Functions
The atmosphere serves several critical functions:

- **Protection:** Shields the Earth from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays.
- **Climate Regulation:** Maintains the Earth's temperature through greenhouse gases.
- **Breathable Air:** Provides oxygen for respiration.
- **Weather and Hydrological Cycle:** Drives weather patterns and the water cycle.

## Human Impact
Human activities have significant impacts on the atmosphere, including:

- **Pollution:** Emission of pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and particulate matter.
- **Global Warming:** Increased CO₂ and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion leading to global temperature rise.
- **Ozone Depletion:** Chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) cause thinning of the ozone layer.

## Conclusion
The atmosphere is a complex and dynamic system essential for life on Earth. Its balance and health are crucial for sustaining ecosystems and human activities. Protecting the atmosphere requires concerted global efforts to mitigate pollution and manage natural resources sustainably.
